  <b>What is Sokoban?</b> <br>
  <br>
Sokoban is a logic game consisting of sets of puzzles or "levels"
similar
to the example shown above. It is <b>not</b> a video game and does
not
require quick reflexes nor does it involve blasting aliens to bits.
Sokoban means warehouse keeper in Japanese. The player pushes
objects
(balls, crates or money bags depending on the version) to their correct
destinations in a crowded "warehouse". The puzzles range from very
simple
to extremely difficult ones requiring many hours of brain work. <br>
  <br>
The game was invented in Japan and won a computer game contest
there.
The original program was written by Hiroyuki Imabayashi and is
Copyright
(c) 1982 by THINKING RABBIT Inc. JAPAN. Since then, many other versions
of the program have been written and additional sets of puzzles have
been
created. Many of these may be found by searching the internet.<br>

  <b>My Sokoban sets:</b> <br>
  <br>
I have created many original sets of Sokoban puzzles (as of September
2010, 1061 puzzles). To use
them,
you must first obtain one of the many Sokoban programs available. My
sets are available here in text format. Click on a set, then
save
it as a text file for use in your Sokoban program. <br>
  <br>
My sets are in two groups: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sasquatch</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Microban</span>. These sets may
be
freely
distributed provided they remain properly credited. <br>
  <br>
Occasionally I get email from someone who is convinced that a
particular
puzzle is impossible. Be assured that (except for unfinished sets) ALL
are solvable. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Sasquatch sets:<br>
  </b>
  <blockquote>These sets
are
general collections where I've
tried to explore a wide variety of puzzle types. Set one has been
described as generally of
just the right difficulty to be fun: not too easy, but (usually) not so
hard that you get frustrated. Later sets tend to vary more in
difficulty (some quite difficult). <br>
    <br>
In sets one through four, puzzle size is limited to 31x18. If you like
huge levels several may be found at the end of each set starting with
set five.<br>
    <br>
Each Sasquatch set contains 50 puzzles. <br>

Microban sets:</span>
  <blockquote>The&nbsp;Microban collection is good for beginners and
children.
Most of the puzzles
are small and illustrate a particular concept.&nbsp;More experienced
players
should also find them interesting, since there is a wide variety and
many can be surprisingly tricky at first glance.<br>
    <br>
Microban sets&nbsp;contain
levels of the following types:<br>
1. Small levels which demonstrate one or two concepts.<br>
2. Levels which are easier than most Sasquatch levels.<br>
3. Levels which are smaller and simpler versions of other levels.<br>
4. Large levels which contain only one object. Use the mouse to place
the object on its destination, then sit back and watch the computer do
all the work. These are I-154, I-155, II-132, II-133, II-134, II-135,
III-101, IV-101, IV-102.<br>
    <br>
Sometimes it is hard to decide whether a level should become a
Sasquatch level or a Microban level, but I try not to worry about it
too much.&nbsp; :-) <br>

    <b><font color="#ed181e">Note</font></b> - The original Sasquatch
set, released in 1999, was revised in 2010. Puzzles #15 and #49 were
changed slightly to make their solutions less trivial. Puzzle #31 was
replaced with an entirely new puzzle. A much improved version of the
original #31 already exists elsewhere in the Sasquatch series.<br>

  <b>Hexagonal Sokoban:<br>
  <br>
  </b>A new type of Sokoban developed during the first week of January
2002.
It all started when I created the first "hexoban" puzzle and challenged
programmers to create a program on which to play it. Check it out at my
